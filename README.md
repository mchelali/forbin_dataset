# Forbin Dataset:  *A collection of historical photographs with archival metadata*

This repository hosts a small **public sample** of the *Forbin Dataset*, a large-scale collection of historical photographs taken or collected by **Victor Forbin (1868–1947)**.  
The full dataset (images + COCO-style annotations + metadata) will be released on **Hugging Face** after the acceptance of the associated data paper.

This GitHub version provides:
- A small curated subset of images  
- COCO-style annotations (segmentation polygons)  
- Archival metadata (Box ID, description, notes, dates when available)  
- A lightweight **explorer interface** (HTML/JS) to preview images and annotations


## 📜 Dataset Description

Images are accompanied by rich metadata and manually extracted segmentation polygons suitable for:

- Computer Vision  
- Document Analysis  
- Cultural Heritage Studies  
- Machine Learning Research  

The sample included here is intended for **illustration and early experimentation only**.  
The upcoming full release will contain tens of thousands of images with complete metadata and annotations.
